# Missed Findings Review  

This repository is a **self-improvement log** for smart contract auditing. It documents past findings I missed during audits, including:  
- Why the issue was missed  
- How to avoid missing similar issues in the future  
- Code examples for vulnerable and fixed versions  
- A running checklist to refine my auditing process
