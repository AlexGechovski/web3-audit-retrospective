# üîç Strategy main ticks are set according to the tick in slot0, leading to incorrect allocation and loss of funds
Summary

## üìå Summary  

    The issue was that a tick in slot0() was used to calculate the price while tick is used to set the last price tick, which means the main price won't be correctly set and the protocol won't put funds in the correct range so there will be loss of fees.

## ‚ùå Why I Missed It  

 I wasn't aware that in UniswapV3 the tick is not the same as the price, I thought it was a simple conversion. I also didn't know that the tick is used to set the last price tick.

## ‚úÖ How I Can Avoid Missing This in the Future  

  In the future I need to research more in depth about forks the protocol uses and the meaning of every variable. Especially learn UniswapV3 and how it works.

Strategy main ticks are set according to the tick in slot0, leading to incorrect allocation and loss of funds
Summary
Main position ticks are set according to the tick in slot0, which is not accurate if the price is near a border. The most obvious case is when the tick just crosses a left boundary, in which the tick is set to the current price tick - 1. In this case, the actual price of the pool is in the current tick in slot0 + 1, but the code will use the tick in slot0. Thus, to be more precise, the sqrtPrice should be used and converted to a tick, which always represents the final swap price of the pool.

Root Cause
In Strategy:207, the tick in slot0 is used to set the main position ticks.

Internal Pre-conditions
None.

External Pre-conditions
Pool is at the boundary.

Attack Path
Uniswap swap causes the tick to be exactly at the boundary.
Impact
Loss of fees as the position will not accumulate as many fees.

PoC
Forked the base chain at block 26874136 with the addresses below and add 1e18 liquidity of each token in the constructor.
The swap will place the price exactly at the boundary, which means a second swap of just 1 wei is enough to push the pool to the next tick. The price is currently tick -1769, but tick -1770 is used as reference, so liquidity is allocated to ticks -1772 to -1768. A 1 wei swap moves the tick to -1769, so only 1 tick spacing has to be crossed to the right to reach the upper -1768 boundary, whereas 3 tick spacing must be crossed to the left. Thus, the position is not symmetrical and will lead to loss of fees.

The reason this happens is that the next tick to the left includes the current tick, so for example while it is at tick -1770, the next tick in the code to the left will also be -1770, having to cross 3 tick spacings to the left to reach the lower boundary, but 1 to the right only.

}
Mitigation
Get the tick from the sqrtPrice and set the position ticks according to it.
