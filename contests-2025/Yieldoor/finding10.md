# üîç Finding Title

## üìå Summary  
_What was the issue?_  
    Theres a problem with pools with odd tick spacing the protocol doesn't calculate for rounding errors and sets wrong wide range for the positon.

## ‚ùå Why I Missed It  
_What caused me to overlook this issue?_  

    Didn't think to check if it works with wrong ticks

## ‚úÖ How I Can Avoid Missing This in the Future  
_What will I do differently next time?_  

    Check calculations more in depth and get more familiar with uniswapV3

## üîé The Finding

Incorrect _setMainTicks Calculations Causing Shifted Main Position After Rebalance
Summary
In the _setMainTicks function Strategy.sol:236 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-yieldoor/blob/main/yieldoor/src/Strategy.sol#L236), the calculation logic is incorrect compared to the documentation. This leads to an unintended shift in the main position when rebalancing, particularly for pools with odd tickSpacing values (e.g., 1 or 5).

Root Cause
The calculation for isLowerSided does not account for rounding errors, causing the boolean value to evaluate as false in some cases. As a result, the main position is incorrectly shifted.
Consider the USDC-USDT-0.01% Uniswap V3 pool, where the spot tick is -1. The current _setMainTicks logic produces a new main position with ticks [-2, 2], while the correctly centered position should be [-3, 1].

Internal Pre-conditions
The strategy must be deployed for a pool with an odd tickSpacing (1 or 5).
External Pre-conditions
the spot tick needs to satisfy the following condition:
spotTick
=
k
√ó
tickSpacing
+
(
tickSpacing
2
)
+
1

where k is an integer.

Example 1: spotTick = -1, tickSpacing = 1
Example 2: spotTick = 2, tickSpacing = 5
Attack Path
Rebalancer rebalances the Strategy.
Impact
The main position shifts to the right by tickSpacing, which is suboptimal and contradicts the intended behavior described in the documentation:

"In order to utilize the most out of the funds within it, 2 positions are made - 1 wider which aims to be 50:50 (or as close as it can get, depending on pool‚Äôs tickspacing). "

Mitigation
Replace the current isLowerSided calculation in Strategy.sol:236 with:

bool isLowerSided = modulo * 2 < tickSpacing;
